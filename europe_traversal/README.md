This program implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, operating
on a graph (via an adjacency list). 

To see the program in action, download the files to your local desktop
and type 'make' into the terminal for the directory containing the files.

The program will prompt you to select a FROM city and TO city. It will then
calculate the shortest possible distance that could be traveled between
the two cities.
