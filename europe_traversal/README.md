# Shortest Path between European Cities
This program implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, operating
on a graph (via an adjacency list). 

## Demoing the program:
1) download the files to your local desktop
2) type `make` into the terminal for the directory containing the files.
3) enter `./map` to execute the program 

The program will prompt you to select a FROM city and TO city. It will then
calculate the shortest possible distance that could be traveled between
the two cities.
