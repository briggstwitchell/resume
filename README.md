### [Transaction Processor](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/transaction_processor)
* This program utilizes OOD, MVC design, and SOLID principles in Java to implement a generic linked link containing Chase transaction data. It can filter, sort, and summarize transaction data based on user commands.

### [Europe Traversal](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/europe_traversal)
* This program uses file I/O in C to construct an adjacency list graph of European cities and implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between any two city node

### [Weather Data Reader](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/weather_data_reader)
* This program generates an interactive map based on NOAA precipitation data in Maine.

### [Academic Performance NCAA](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/academic_performance_NCAA)
* This program uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that examine NCAA academic performance.
