# Resume projects
These projects demonstrate some of the programming skills I've obtained as a masters student at Northeastern. To learn more about me check out my [personal website](http://briggy-artist.org/) (that I created) and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briggstwitchell/).

### Animal Death Calculator (mockup):
> [This project](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/mock_animal_death_calculator/tree/main) is a mock up of a tool I'd like to spend more time creating. This tool calculates the estimated amount of animal deaths per year based on different forms of meat consumption. I've input some very rough estimates as a start, and mostly focused on getting the tool working. I'd like to collaborate with an animal right organization to add this tool to their website as a means to inform meat consumers of the impact of their diet on the number of animals killed in a year. This preliminary implementation is rather sloppy, as I did it in a morning. However, I think it could be recreated as a very impactful tool, given that it's also backed up by robustly research statistics on the number of deaths caused by different forms of meat consumption. [Click here](https://briggstwitchell.github.io/mock_animal_death_calculator/) to try out the mock tool.

### Patient Walking Metadata at MedRhythms:
> As a software engineer intern at [MedRhythms](https://medrhythms.com/), I worked on various projects related to patient clinical data, such as surfacing patient time zone and standard deviation of step precision for analysis by company researchers. The application was implemented in Python/Django. I of course cannot demonstrate any part of this work as it was proprietary.

### Mapping Maine Healthcare Data:
> Collaborated with Maine based cancer center to develop interactive map containing various metrics related to their cancer research goals; implemented in Python with GeoPandas and Folium libraries. I signed an NDA to work on this project and therefore cannot show any of the code. However, [click here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ur6k6vg3qhwxijd/dual_maps.html?dl=0) for a demo of the product with all sensitive data removed.

### Trail recommender:
> [This program](https://github.com/fabigazi/TrailRecommender) implements a trail sorting algorithm in Python that accounts for a variety of user preference inputs; utilizes the Gower Distance function and leverages Pandas and GeoPy. For this project, I led a team of four fellow graduate students for our algorithms class.

### Older projects
I've kept some of my older projects below. These projects certainly don't represent how I'd implement code now, but they do show some of the progress I've made since beginning software development.

##### Transaction Processor
> This program ([link](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/transaction_processor)) utilizes OOD, MVC design, and SOLID principles in Java to implement a generic linked link containing Chase transaction data. It can filter, sort, and summarize transaction data based on user commands.

##### Europe Traversal
> This program ([link](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/europe_traversal)) uses file I/O in C to construct an adjacency list graph of European cities and implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between any two city node

##### Weather Data Reader
> This program ([link](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/weather_data_reader)) generates an interactive map based on NOAA precipitation data in Maine.

##### Academic Performance NCAA
> This program ([link](https://github.com/briggstwitchell/resume/tree/main/academic_performance_NCAA))uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that examine NCAA academic performance.
